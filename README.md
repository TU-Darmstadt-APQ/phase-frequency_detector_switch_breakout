Switch Breakout Board for Phase-Frequency Detector
===================
This repository contains the [KiCad 7](https://www.kicad.org/) design files for a toggle switch to be used with the [phase-frequency detector module](https://github.com/TU-Darmstadt-APQ/phase-frequency_detector). The frontpanel switch selects the gain sign of the fast proportional-derivative controller.
